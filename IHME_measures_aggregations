Can diferent measures be aggragated to obtain totals?
We have created a dashboard with charts representing various measures acorss years for a given location across causes.
The chart consists of vertically stacked bars representing valuses corresponding to various measures for different causes.
The units can either be numbers or rates.
We calculate total as the sum of values associated with causes for a given year and location. The total is then used to denote a representative for for a given year and also
for calculating the percentage breakdown for each cause.
We would like to confirm if the total for all measures can be calculated as a simple sum of values.
The reason behind our doubts is the observation, that the value associalted with 'All Causes' for a given measure does not equal to the sum of individual values associated with causes.
We have observed that for example that the value associated with 1.6 Eating disorders is the sum of values representing 1.6.1. Bulimia nervosa and 1.6.2 Anorexia nervosa. Similarly, the value
assocoated with 1. Mental disorders is equal to the sum of values corresponding to causes forming the higher herarchy group starting with 1.1 Other mental disorders ending on 1.10 Schizophrenia.
Of course once 1.6 Eating disorders are included, then 1.6.1 and 1.6.2 cannot be added separately.
